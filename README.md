# KnockBox
This project focuses on an interactive device that communicates with identical boxes, independent of location. The boxes are connected via the Internet, exchanging knocking sounds and audio messages.

The repository consists of:
1. docs (Product Brief and Project Requirements)
2. electrical (Schematics and PCB design)
3. software (Testing of Submodules)

The code of the final Knockbox and documentation on the hardware development are still under revision and have not yet been included in this repository.
