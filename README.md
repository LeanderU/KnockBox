# KnockBox

Want to stay in contact with your friends, family, or partner over long distances? The KnockBox was created to foster a sense of proximity to them. Instead of physically knocking on their door, you can knock on your box, and theirs will imitate your physical knocking. Additionally, the pair of identical boxes can exchange short audio messages, similar to Walkie Talkies.  

## How it works:

This project focuses on an interactive device that communicates with identical boxes, independent of their locations. The boxes are connected via the Internet, allowing them to exchange knocking sounds and audio messages. A servo imitates the physical knocking coming from a user of another box, while an LED indicates if a new audio message has been received. The user interface is limited to only one button that's used for playing the received audio message, recording a message, and sending it.

## Repository Contents:
